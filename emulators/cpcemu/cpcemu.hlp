#[ABOUT HELP.UK]
ABOUT HELP
  The file CPCEMU.HLP contains the on-line help for several languages.
  Currently CPCEMU supports 4 languages:
  UK - English
  GR - German
  FR - French
  SP - Spanish

  A TOPIC in language "LL" is introduced by "#[TOPIC.LL]" in the first
  column of a line. Note that you must use upper case letters for topics.
  It is also possible to have one topic for more languages, eg.
  "#[TOPIC.UK,TOPIC.GR]".

  References are simply written as "[Reference]". They can be mixed
  upper and lower case. If they are not surrounded by quotes, you can
  click on them and get a follow-on topic.
  This follow-on topic is found by searching the help file for
  the topic "REFERENCE.LL" where "LL" = selected language.
  If no "REFERENCE.LL" is found, the first "REFERENCE.xx" is taken
  (normally xx=UK); if this also does not exist, the error message
  "Topic not found" appears.
  If more than one reference is on a single line, the first one is taken.

  There are pre-defined "topics" [ENGLISH], [GERMAN], [FRENCH], [SPANISH]
  to select a language.

  Most references are in the message file CPCEMU.MSG.

#[#ENDIF.GR,#IFCPC.GR]
-#IFCPC.GR, #ENDIF.GR
  Diese Steuerbefehle ermöglichen eine bedingte Konfiguration je nach
  gewünschtem CPC:
    #IFCPC <CPC-Typ> ... #ENDIF
  Als <CPC-Typ> sind alle 5 Typen wie bei [CPC-Typ] zulässig.
  Somit kommen Sie mit einer Konfigurationsdatei für alle CPCs aus.
  In den Batch-Dateien CPC464.BAT, CPC664.BAT, CPC6128.BAT wird der
  gewünschte CPC durch Kommandozeilen-Parameter gewählt.

[Konfigurationsdatei]
#[AMSDOS ABGESCHALTET.GR]
AMSDOS abgeschaltet (0)
AMSDOS_DISABLED = 0,1
  Verbietet die Initialisierung des AMSDOS. Das ist sinnvoll, wenn Sie
  viele Programme von Kassette laden möchten, ohne vorher immer den
  Befehl '|TAPE' eingeben zu müssen.

[Setup-Menü]
[Konfigurationsdatei]
#[AMSDOS-BESCHLEUNIGUNG.GR]
AMSDOS-Beschleunigung (1)
AMSDOS_SPEEDUP = 0,1
  Das AMSDOS-ROM wird so modifiziert, daß Diskettenzugriffe beschleunigt
  werden. Dies wird durch Minimieren der Motor-Wartezeiten erreicht, die
  für den Emulator nicht nötig sind.

  b1 = 1 -> Zeige Z80-Emulations-Fehler (schnell)
  b2 = 1 -> Zeige Port-Fehler
  Mit 3 werden Port-Fehler ignoriert.

[Setup-Menü]
[Konfigurationsdatei]
#[FARBBILDSCHIRM.GR]

COLOUR_SCREEN = 0,1
  Emulation eines Grün- oder Farbmonitors, indem die Farbpalette
  angepaßt wird.

[Konfigurationsdatei]
#[CRTC-TYP.GR]
CRTC-Typ (1)
CRTC_TYPE = 0,1,2
  Emulation der unterschiedlichen CRTC-Typen.
  
  Für Demos muss in der Regel vor deren Start Typ 0 oder Typ 1
  eingestellt werden, abhängig vom Demo.

[Setup-Menü]
[Konfigurationsdatei]
#[M4 ERLAUBT.GR]
M4 Erlaubt (1)
M4_ENABLED = 0,1
  Emulation eines M4-Boards (http://www.spinpoint.org).
  
  Benötigt ein konfiguriertes M4.ROM im ROM-Pfad.

[Setup-Menü]
[Konfigurationsdatei]
#[SD-CARD-BETRIEBSMODUS.GR]
SD-Card-Betriebsmodus (0)
M4_SDCARD_MODE = 0,1
  Betriebsmodus der emulierten SD-Karte in SymbOS.
  
  Im Modus 0 wird beim Start von SymbOS ein FAT32-Image aus dem
  Host-Verzeichnis erzeugt, das als SD-Karte des M4-Boards emuliert wird
  (siehe [M4_SD_PATH]). Beim nächsten System-Reset wird veränderter Inhalt
  des Images zurück in das Host-Verzeichnis geschrieben.
  
  Im Modus 1 (*experimentell*!) wird live ein FAT32-System auf diesem
  Host-Verzeichnis emuliert, sowohl lesend als auch schreibend.

[Setup-Menü]
[Konfigurationsdatei]
#[M4_SD_PATH.GR]
SD-Card-Pfad
M4_SD_PATH = "<Pfad+Dateiname>"
  Pfad, der als SD-Card emuliert wird.

COMPANY_NAME = 0..7
  Firmenname auf dem Eröffnungsbildschirm.
  0 = Isp
  1 = Triumph
  2 = Saisho
  3 = Solavox
  4 = Awa
  5 = Schneider
  6 = Orion

CPC_TYPE = 0..5
  Setzt den gewünschten CPC-Typ
  0 = CPC 464
  1 = CPC 664
  2 = CPC 6128
  3 = CPC 464+ (?)
  4 = CPC 6128+ (?)
  5 = KC compact (CPC 6128)
  6 = unbekannt
  Um die Typen 3, 4 oder 5 zu benutzen, müssen Sie zuerst entsprechende
  ROM-Abbilder in CPCEMU.CFG eintragen.

#[ÜBER HILFE.GR]
Über Hilfe
  Die Datei CPCEMU.HLP enthält die On-Line-Hilfe für einige Sprachen.
  Zur Zeit unterstützt CPCEMU 4 Sprachen:
  UK - Englisch
  GR - Deutsch
  FR - Französisch
  SP - Spanisch

  Ein "THEMA" in der Sprache "LL" wird durch "#[THEMA.LL]" in der ersten
  Spalte einer Zeile eingeleitet. Es muß in Grßbuchstaben geschrieben sein.
  Es ist auch möglich, ein Thema für mehrere Sprachen zu haben, z.B. ist
  "#[THEMA.UK,THEMA.GR]" für Englisch und Deutsch.

  Referenzen werden einfach als "[Referenz]" geschrieben. Sie können aus
  Groß- und Kleinbuchstaben bestehen. Wenn sie nicht von "" umschlossen
  sind, können Sie sie anwählen, um das Folgethema zu sehen.

  Das Hilfesystem findet dieses Folgethema, indem es die Hilfedatei nach
  dem Thema "REFERENZ.LL" (mit "LL"=gewählte Sprache) durchsucht.
  Wenn es das Thema "REFERENZ.LL" nicht finded, nimmt es das erste
  "REFERENZ.xx" (mit normalerweise xx=UK); wenn das auch nicht existiert,
  erscheint die Fehlermeldung "Thema nicht gefunden".
  Wenn mehrere Referenzen in einer Zeile stehen, wird die erste ausgewählt.

  Im Hilfesystem vordefinierte "Themen" sind
  [ENGLISH], [GERMAN], [FRENCH], [SPANISH], um eine Sprache zu wählen.

  Die meisten Referenzen stehen in der Meldungsdatei CPCEMU.MSG.

  Il est effacé à chaque redémarrage de CPCEMU.
  Après avoir quitté l'émulateur, vous pouvez l'envoyer sur votre
  imprimante avec "COPY <nom_de_fichier> prn:", ou en utilisant EDIT.

  Autre méthode :
     - dans le fichier de configuration CPCEMU.CFG, mettre la ligne :
                          PRINTER="prn"

#[A PROPOS DE L'AIDE.FR]
A propos de l'aide
------------------

  Le fichier CPCEMU.HLP contient une aide en ligne en quatre langues :
  UK - Anglais
  GR - Allemand
  FR - Français
  SP - Espagnol

  Une RUBRIQUE dans la langue "LL" est précédée par "#[RUBRIQUE.LL]" dans
  la première colonne d'une ligne. Notez que vous devez utiliser des
  majuscules pour les titres des rubriques. Avec la version 1.5, les
  majuscules accentuées sont autorisées.
  Il est aussi possible d'avoir une rubrique en plusieurs langues, par
  exemple "#[RUBRIQUE.UK,RUBRIQUE.GR]".

  Les références sont simplement écrites "[Référence]". On peut y mêler
  majuscules et minuscules. Si elles ne sont pas encadrées par des
  guillemets, vous pouvez cliquer dessus et avoir une rubrique "à suivre".
  Ctte rubrique à suivre est trouvée en cherchant, dans le fichier
  d'aide, la rubrique "REFERENCE.LL" (avec "LL" désignant toujours
  la langue sélectionnée). Si aucune "REFERENCE.LL" n'est trouvée,
  la première "REFERENCE.xx" est adoptée (normalement, xx=UK). Si celle-ci
  n'existe pas non plus, le message d'erreur "Topic not found" apparaît.
  S'il y a plus d'une référence sur la même ligne, c'est la première
  qui est choisie.

  Les rubriques pré-définies [ENGLISH], [GERMAN], [FRENCH] et [SPANISH]
  permettent de sélectionner une langue.

  Davantage de références se trouvent dans le fichier CPCEMU.MSG.

#[ACERCA DE LA AYUDA.SP]
Acerca de la Ayuda
==================

  El fichero CPCEMU.HLP contiene la ayuda en línea en varios idiomas.
  Actualmente CPCEMU soporta 4 idiomas:
  UK - Inglés
  GR - Alemán
  FR - Francés
  SP - Español

  un TEMA en el idioma "LL" es introducido por "#[TEMA.LL]" en la primera
  columna de una línea. Observa se deben usar mayúsculas para los temas.
  También es posible tener un tema para varios idiomas, p.ej.
  "#[TEMA.UK,TEMA.GR]".

  Las referencias se denotan simplemente como "[Referencia]". Pueden
  mezclarse mayúsculas y minúsculas. Si no estan entre comillas, se pueden
  seleccionar y obtener un tema asociado.
  Este tema asociado se encuentra buscando en el fichero de ayuda el tema
  "REFERENCIA.LL" con "LL"=idioma seleccionado.
  Si no encuentra el "REFERENCIA.LL", el primer "REFERENCIA.xx" es elegido
  (normalmente xx=UK); si éste tampoco existe, aparece el mesaje de error
  "Tema no encontrado".
  Si existe más de una referencia en una sola línea, se elige la primera
  referencia. 

  Hay "temas" predefinidos [ENGLISH], [GERMAN], [FRENCH], [SPANISH] para
  seleccionar un idioma.

  La mayoría de las referencias están en el fichero de mensajes CPCEMU.MSG.
